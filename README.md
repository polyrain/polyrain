### Welcome to my GitHub profile

I'm a (soon-to-be) Software Engineer currently working on a variety of projects across a number of fields. See my pins below to see a sample of these; we've got something for everyone, from UNO to Haskell insanity. Currently trying to finish my final semester @ UQ so I can get onto my own projects.
